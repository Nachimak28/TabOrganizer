# TabOrganizer
A simple chrome extension to export all your open tabs(URLs) in a window to a CSV file to come back to it later.

## Motivation
I keep a lot of chrome tabs open for reference later, maintaining a tab of all of them in my head so I can get back to my work faster. So, in order to not lose everything I have been working on at any point allows you to export out the tab list in CSV format. This way you have a list that you can paste into any spreadsheet and grab all the details you need.

## What does it do?
Exports all URLs from all tabs to a CSV file where the first column holds the Group Name if inside a tab Group (YES chrome gives that functionality) and the second column hold the Tab URL. Then I close all my tabs and start with a clean slate


## How to use it?

### Load and Test the Extension
* Clone this repo
* Open Google Chrome.
* Navigate to chrome://extensions/.
* Enable Developer mode at the top right corner.
* Click Load unpacked and select your TabOrganizer folder.
* Click the extension icon and then the “Export Tabs to CSV” button to generate the CSV file.

## What next?
RAG is the way to go. Shall directly integrate this into a bigger RAG system so you can search later for it. Maybe not the best idea but works for my personal use :)

If something does not work, open up an issue. Got the whole code generated using ChatGPT4. - so there is a fair chance the code quality might be abysmal :D
